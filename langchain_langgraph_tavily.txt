LangChain, LangGraph, and Tavily - Documentation Overview

1. LangChain

LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by large
language models (LLMs). It provides tools for chaining together prompts,
memory, agents, and retrieval mechanisms.

Key Features: - Prompt templates - LLM wrappers - Chains for sequential
operations - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - Tools & Agents
system - Integrations with vector databases

Use Cases: - Chatbots - Research assistants - RAG systems - Workflow
automation

2. LangGraph

LangGraph is a graph-based workflow engine designed for building
multi-agent AI systems. It is inspired by React and state machines,
allowing developers to control AI agent flow precisely.

Key Features: - Node-based execution flow - Persistent and mutable
state - Branching, loops, and conditional execution - Agent
orchestration - Scalable research and automation pipelines

Use Cases: - Multi-agent collaboration - Research pipelines - Automated
workflows - Agent state management

3. Tavily Search API

Tavily is an AI-powered search API optimized for research and factual
data retrieval. It provides high-quality search results with structured
outputs.

Key Features: - Fast and accurate search results - Summaries of web
pages - Citation-supported retrieval - Easy integration with LangChain

Use Cases: - Research agents - Q&A systems - Fact-checking - Automated
report generation

Summary:

LangChain helps structure LLM operations, LangGraph orchestrates agents
using graph workflows, and Tavily provides accurate search results.
Together, they form a powerful stack for building intelligent research
assistants.
